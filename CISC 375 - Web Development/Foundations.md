- Grid based
	- 12 columns (cells)
		- Going over 12 bumps down an element below
	- Items span multiple columns
- Responsive
	- Adapts based on window size 
		- Devices have different window sizes
		- Browsers can be resized
	- Sizing Classes
		- Small/Medium/Large "devices" (screens)
			- Large inherits medium, medium inherits small
			- Default size is 12 if not specified
		- Assign multiple of these to account for each case
			- `Medium - 8` - take up 2/3 of screen on medium sized devices
			- `Small - 12` - take up 3/3 of screen on small devices
		- `Auto` can be used to automatically size elements to all fit on a row with other 'auto' elements
			- Ex. `large-auto`
			- Good for number of elements that aren't factors of 12 (Ex. 5)
