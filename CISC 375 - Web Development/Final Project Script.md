Hello and welcome to the St. Paul Crime Data Explorer, I'm Matt Lao, one of the developers. And today, I'll be walking you through the key features of our application.

[Navigate to search page]

As you can see, on the initial page load, the map displays the one-thousand most recent crimes in St. Paul, with markers for each neighborhood.

[Focus on neighborhood markers]

These markers provide a quick overview, and clicking on them shows the number of crimes in that specific neighborhood.

[Types a location (University of St. Thomas, St. Paul MN) into the search box.]

Need information about a specific location? Just type it in, and watch as the map updates, along with the result below, which update based on the neighborhoods visible on the map.

[Show Advanced Search]

Let's say we want to narrow it down. There are fields for:
- Crime type
- Specific neighborhoods
- Dates
- The number of results
All of this is just a few clicks away.

[Click on an individual crime, displaying detailed information]

Speaking of clicks, clicking on a specific crime gives you more details, including the exact location where it occurred.

[Navigate to the upload page.]

Now, let's talk about contribution. On the upload page, you can submit a new record of a crime to keep the data accurate and up-to-date.

[Show the newly submitted record and demonstrate the delete function]

Once you submit a record, you can see it in the list. And if needed, you have the option to delete it.

That's a wrap for our St. Paul Crime Data Explorer demo. Dive in, explore, and empower yourself with valuable insights. Thanks for watching!
