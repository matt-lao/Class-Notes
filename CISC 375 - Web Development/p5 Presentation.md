# Processing (p5)
- Project by Cory Reas & Ben Fry (2001)
	- Students at MIT media lab
	- Flexible software sketchbook and language for learning how to code within the context of visual art
	- Java based
- Java Applets
	- In the early 2000 Java applets were a popular way to deliver rich graphical content on the web
	- Precursor to JavaScript
	- Processing simplified the creation of applets
- Lauren McCarthy + Processing = p5.js
	- Programmer and artist, teamed up with processing to create p5.js while at NYU

# p5.js
- Library of functions 
	- Simplify and abstract the process of creating interactive visuals in the browser
- Leverages the Canvas API
	- HTML element
	- Not the easiest to interact with
- UI oriented + Beginner Friendly
	- Abstracts some of the complexity of Canvas API & JavaScript
	- Helps the focus be on what to code instead of how to code it
	- Designed in such a way that actually helps ease a newer program into the feel of how JavaScript actually works

# Features
- Text
	- Methods to easily create and place UI elements such as shapes and texts on the canvas
	- The canvas based on a coordinate system, so you can easily place something like text wherever on the screen by passing the string and an x/y coordinated
- Interesting features that interact with physical hardware
	- Webcam interactivity
	- Microphone

# Academic Contexts
- Creative Coding 
	- Used in classes to teach creative coding and coding design concepts
- Presentation Medium
	- Websites designed with p5.js make for a neat tool to present on a particular topic in a unique way.
	- Venus story
		- Presentation on the roman goddess
- Concept/Data Visualization
	- Visual Synonyms - concept
	- Modal Flow - data
		- Visualizes commute patterns from Santiago, CL

- "web3"
- Art and it's accessibility convo

# Futuristic/New Age Web Design

# Sample
