# Processing
- Project started in 2001 by Cory Reas and Ben Fry who were students at the MIT media lab
	- Wanted to create something to help them with their work
- Built on top of Java
	- Utilized applets to easily displaying things on the web back in the day
	- Now javascript is used for web development primarily
- p5.js
	- Lauren McCarthy and Processing created p5.js as a way to do what Processing did but in JavaScript
	- Primarily used for
		- Art
		- Data Visualization
		- Web Design
	- processing.js is a thing, but p5 is more popular
	- "Library"
		- Library of functions to help simplify coding in Javascript for beginners
	- Editor application
