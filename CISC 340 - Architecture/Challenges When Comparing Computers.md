## CPU
![[Pasted image 20230911173144.png | 700]]
- Cores - Processing unit, each core can execute an instruction independently
- Cache - Very fast memory reserved for specific special memory
- GHz - Clock Rate of the processor
## CPU Clock
- Measured in GHz
	- 1 GHz is 1 billion cycles a second
	- Each cycle represents a unit of work being completed
- Clock rate isn't everything
	- Unit of work differs between CPUs
	- Additionally, the same program can take a different number of steps on different ISAs
	- Instead -> Benchmark

## Bench Marking
- Gets at the heart of how to software will actually run
- But not always feasible since it requires access to the hardware
