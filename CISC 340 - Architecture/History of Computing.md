## Early Programming
- 1801 - Joseph Marie Jacquard invest a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automatically weave fabric designs
	- This was the inspiration for punch cards a century later
- 1820-1830 - Charles Babbage designed the "Difference Engine" & "Analytical Engine"
	- Steam driven calculation machines
	- However, could not be built at the time due to technological limitations
- 1840 - Ada Lovelace writes first computer program
	- It was a "description" of how to compute Bernoulli number on the Analytical Engine
- 1880 - Herman Hollerith invents the punch card
	- Electromechanical tabulating device
	- Aided the 1890 US census
		- Completed ahead of time
	- Went on to found IBM

## Theory of Modern Computing
- 1936 - Alan Turing
	- Turing machine: Theoretical machine that can read and modify symbols on an "infinite" tape according to a table of rules
	- Turing Complete
		- A system that can solve all the same problems as Turing machine
			- Can compute any solvable algorithm
		- Some languages are considered Turing complete
- 1945 - ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)
	- Commonly cited as first programmable all digital computer
	- Was giant and expensive (30 tons + $400k)
	- Took a large group of people to operate
	- Built to calculate ballistics tables

## Hardware Advances
- 1947 - Bell Labs creates transistors
	- Replacement for volatile vacuum tubes -- very inefficient since they could break occasionally
- 1950 - magnetic drums used for memory
	- Precursor of hard disks
	- Functioned similar to RAM
- 1951 - Tape drive used for secondary storage
- UNIVAC - 1951
	- Eckert and Mauchly provided the first UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) to the US Census Bureau
	- Unlike ENIAC, UNIVAC used 
		- Binary-based architecture
		- Weighed 8 tons
		- Used punch card interface
	- Notably used magnetic drums and tape storage
- Transistors
	- 1954 Bell Labs created TRADIC (Transistorized Digital Computer)
		- First all transistor computer
		- Much smaller than predecessors
		- Used fraction of the energy
	- Opened the gateway for mass production of smaller computers
- Rise of Personal Computer
	- 1959 - Introduction of the first integrated circuit
	- 1959 - IBM 1401
		- First popularized mass-produced computer
		- By mid 60s over 10000 systems were installed
		- Cheap price (rented for $2500/month) and ease of programming made it a success

## Rise of Programming Languages
- 1940-1950 - "Programming Languages" were machine codes -- Binary instructions that directed computer hardware
	- Took long time to create and debug code, but there were only a few machines
- As computers become more prevalent and understandable languages were developed
	- First was Assembly - Uses symbolic names and mnemonics to represent machine instructions
	- One step above binary and still machine specific
- First Compiler
	- Admiral Grace Hopper
		- 1952 - created the first compiler A-0 which translated mathematical code into machine code
		- 1962 - Her team created FLOW-MATIC the first programming to use English words
			- Precursor to COBOL
- Language Trends
	- First computer were very expensive
		- Cheaper to have programmer enter binary
	- As computers go cheaper programmers became the dominant expense
	- To remedy this, languages were developed that were easy to use, easy to learn, and can be used in many different ways
		- This way more people could learn to program, driving down the cost
