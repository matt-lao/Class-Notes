- History of Computing and Computers
- RISC vs CISC
- Measuring Performance
    - Cycle, Clock rate, Clock Period, CPI, CPU time, etc
    - You will want to know how to calculate performance, time, cpi, etc
- Moore's Law
- Amdahl's Law
- MIPS
    - Registers
        - Size, number, naming conventions, vs. memory, special registers ($zero, $ra...)
    - Instructions
        - Types (ex: r-type vs i-type vs j types)
            - Â how they are stored in memory and their parts
        - Know all the ones introduced in class
            - add, addi, sub, subi, mul, lw, sw, and, or, andi, ori, j, beq, bne, stl, li, la, sll, srl,
        - Psuedo-instructions vs. real MIPS
        - Labels
        - syscall
    - General MIPS abilities you should have
        - reading and understanding a MIPS program
        - Work with memory
            - .data
                - data types
                    - .word
                - arrays, variables
        - Know how to use jumping  
            - if statements
            - loops
        - Translate Java to MIPS
        - Rewrite MIPS to be more efficient or use different instruction
- Data Representation
    - Hex
    - Binary
        - all math
    - Two's Compliment
    - You should be able to convert between decimal and any of the above formats
    - You should know how the number of bits used in the representation changes the value range
    - Know how to do arithmetic in all forms
