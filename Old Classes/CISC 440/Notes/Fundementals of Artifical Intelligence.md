## What is AI?
- Thinking + Perception + Action
	- Still too fundemental
- Model is needed
	- Representation
		- How is it constructed?
		- How will the problem be solved?
		- How many possible combinations of solutions?
	- Constraints
		- Rule of the game/situation/problem
		- Affects the number of solutions possible
	- Algorithms

>[!General Definition]
>Algorithms enabled by constraint exposed by representation support models targeted at thinking, perception and action.

## Rational Decisions
- Rational - maximally achieving predefined goals
- Concerns decisions being made (not thought process)
- Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of outcomes
- <b>Being rational means maximizing your expected utility</b>

## Brain
- Brains (human minds) are very good at making rational decisions, but not perfect 
- Brains aren’t as modular as software, so hard to reverse engineer! 
- “Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight” 
- Lessons learned from the brain: <b>memory and simulation</b> are key to decision making

## History
- !842 Lady Lovelace: 
	- “The analytical engine has no presentation to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform” 
- 1940-1950: Early days
	- 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain
	- 1950: Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” 
- 1950—70: Excitement- (a honeymoon period) 
	- 1950s: Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist, Gelernter's Geometry Engine 
	- 1956: Dartmouth meeting: “Artificial Intelligence” adopted 
	- 1965: Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning
- 1970—90: Knowledge-based approaches (AI Winter) 
	- 1969—79: Early development of knowledge-based systems 
	- 1980—88: Expert systems industry booms 
	- 1988—93: Expert systems industry busts: “AI Winter”
- 1990—2000: Statistical approaches (AI Spring)
	- Resurgence of probability, focus on uncertainty  
	- General increase in technical depth 
	- Agents and learning systems… “AI Spring”? 
- 2000—: Where are we now?
