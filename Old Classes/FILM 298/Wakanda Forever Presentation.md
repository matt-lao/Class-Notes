-  Black women primary lead this film  
	- Mourning the loss of Chadwick Boseman - pressures to recast Tchalla - NYT
		- "The hashtag [#recastTChalla](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23recastTChalla&src=typed_query) went viral, followed by a Change.org [petition with more than 60,000 signatures](https://www.change.org/p/marvel-recast-t-challa-to-honor-chadwick-boseman-in-the-black-panther-franchise-2) contending, “If Marvel Studios removes T’Challa, it would be at the expense of the audiences (especially Black boys and men) who saw themselves in him." (Tillet | NYT)
	- However, recasting TChalla would almost be a slap in the face to the extremely capable women who are and were able to carry the film in his absence.
		- Also provided a unique opportunity to touch on the topic of grief, and the trauma assoicated with loosing a loved one in the context of the black community (which is unfortunately a phenomon that is all to common)
	- The women in this film are
		- Heroic
		- Complex
		- Leaders
		- Are probably the most fem presenting characters in the MCU 
- Marvels Problematic Representation of Women in the past
	- Unfortunately the representation of women in Marvel movies has not been ideal
	- Black Widow is an example of a character, while extremely strong and capable, is overtly sexualized and is sadly not given the complexity her character deserves.
		- Almost has become a stereotype in her own right, as the "overtly sexualized femme fatale" (Velasquez | GR)
		- Seen more for her body then for her character which is unfortunate
	- Captian Marvel is an example of where her character is empowering, she fails to explore the complexties and struggles unique to be women in this superhero role.
		- Besides maybe a few references to casual misgony
	- Otherwise seen as side characters 
		- Gomora - Guardians of the Galaxy
		- Scarlett Witch 
			- Luckily has her own piece of focus now, but had that sort of undone by Dr. Strange (MVM)
- Complexity of these characters
	- The characters in this film are different
	- They are seen more for their character and less for their gender
	- The film challenges the norm in terms of gender roles 
		- Somewhat gender neutral representation of Shuri and Riri
	- Capable beyond superpowers
		- Intellectual ability - Shuri and Riri 
		- Physical ability - Okoye and the Dora Milaje
		- Leadership ability - Queen Romonda
	- Good guy/bad guy dichotmy is made more complex with Shuri and Romonda
		- In the first movie TChalla represented tradition and rootedness while Killmonger contrasted it with pushes for change and evolution.
		- Similar dichotmy is observed between Shuri and Romonda yet they take more mature and thoughtful stances. (Don't try and kill each other, vye for power)
			- Romonda - Spiritualism
			- Shuri - Technology and modernization
- Queen Romonda's spiritualism highlighted by the film
	- Scene by the fire
	- Flashback/callback later in the film
- Shuri and Riri's intellectualism is highlighted by Marvel's deep pockets
	- Any scene regarding CGI
- Physicallity and Power represented in Okoye and the Dora Milaje
- Potential problematic represenation
	- Masculization/Hypersexualization of black women
		- Misogynoir
			- "Throughout history, darker-skinned Black women have always been demonized and looked at as men, for the features that they have and the qualities that they embody. Black women have negatively been seen as strong, competitive, aggressive and loud, all qualities that society says that women should not have. Because our society has been and continues to be run by white men, their views have been systematically placed in our society. They believe that women should be the complete opposite of them in nature, meaning quiet, docile people, who they can control. It is our lack of proximity to whiteness that makes us “non-feminine.”" (Blake)

		- Why it's harmful
			- "The masculinization and defeminization of African American women and girls is one form of implicit bias that contributes to social approval of violence against them. When a woman or girl is perceived as masculine, she is also more likely to be seen as strong, aggressive, and less feminine. These traits are typically associated with gender-conforming men and, consequently, such implicit bias may cause a school administrator or teacher to perceive sexually victimized Black girls as capable of handling the harassment themselves (like men) and less in need of protection." (Tonnesen)

	- Afrofuturism - More of a vision for expanding the role of women and gender in the future rather than addressing realities of the present day
		- "I think it's not about pushing women forward or holding men back, it's about telling the story that is organic" - Producer Nate Moore (who worked closely with Ryan Coogler)
		- However does touch on political realities of the present day/past
	- Does the film challenge or complicate this notion of masculization?
		- One the one hand it represents the characters authentically
		- Is there a legimate risk of viewers walking away and be desensitized to violence against black women because they stereotype them as being more strong and independent?
		- Societal perception vs. film misrepresentation 
			- Is the burden on this film to change this notion when it is more about how society percieves black women? 
			- The film is not necessarily misrepresenting black women, but is it highlighting the unique struggles enough?
	- The characters do expereince pain and grief which does humanize them and make them realistic which helps.
