V.              Critiques of Wakanda Forever's Portrayal of Colonialism

a.      Depiction of the UN being walked over by Wakanda (Queen Ramonda): While empowering and almost symbolic form of justice for African nations exploited by Western forces, it is an unrealistic representation that glosses over the injustices that minority representatives face in these sorts of legal bodies. Especially when considering more recent examples in places like Tennessee where minority representatives like Rep. Justin Jones were expelled due to “disorderly conduct”, when trying to speak out against gun violence. However, when Queen Ramonda gets her chance to speak out, she gets all the liberties and some. No one cutting her off, asking to reclaim her time, she gets to put on a whole display that could be considered out of line in any real-world assembly. It’s a satisfying way to flip the power dynamics of the real world on its head, but does the mainstream audience come away thinking these minority nations can fend for themselves, or much less, have a seat at the table in the first place? There was a potential here to subvert the audience’s expectations and show the injustice in these diplomatic systems, and yet still show that Wakanda has the capability to overcome it.

b.      The awkward tension of a fear of the outside world, coupled with the reality that Talokan and Wakanda can probably fend for themselves given the advanced technology and resources they have. Does this imply that they are not aware of how to best use their own resources? They obviously do, however is the representative of how nations with lucrative resources in the past have operated? In a way this sort of presents a somewhat unrealistic idea that if a nation has lucrative resources, that they can then defend themselves or at least stand a chance. The film also does a lot of saying that the Western world is dangerous and should not be trusted but does not do a ton in the way of showing it.

VI.            Conclusion

a.      Discussion of whether these critiques the films portrayal of colonialism and imperialism significantly harm or limit the mainstream audience’s view on the matter.

b.      Burden of representation is it the movie’s place to represent these harsh realities to their fullest extent or should that burden of education be on the Western world.

c.       Symbolic justice and whether representing an idealistic reality or representing a reality that is more authentic is more important/effective. (Showing Wakanda as a nation that can just walk all over the UN is not the most realistic unfortunately, but is the symbolic justice it achieves more important to represent here?

d.      In regards to race and representation more broadly, what should we be aware of in regards to each approach (representing a harsh reality vs. representing an idea of how things could be if racial justice was achieved).
