## In 1-D
- Deviation alone is not enough -> Spread tells more
- How to measure dispersion? -> Standard deviation
- If a point is many SDs away, likely an outlier
	- Convenient measurement: ***z-score***
		$$z = \frac{x_{i}-\bar x}{S} $$
		- Tells how far above or below the mean a data point is
		- Example: How to compare two different athletes in different sports?
			- See how far above the mean they are in their respective sports
- Normal distribution
	- Convenient to conceptualize in standard deviations
	- z-scores above or below +- 2.76 can be considered outliers
- Influential points
	- If removing the point changes the kurtosis/skewness significantly, should probably be considered an outlier

## In 2-D
- Deviation from the centroid
- Mahalanobis distance

	- Deviation matrix - $(x_{i}-x)$
	- Inverse covariance matrix - $\Sigma^{-1}$
	- Transposed (changed dimensions) -  $(x_{i}-x)^{T}$ 
	- Result of MD is distance away from the centroid in standardized form
	- Follows chi-squared distribution
- Influential points
	- If removing the point changes any of the important descriptive statistics, it is likely influential 

## Comparing z-scores to chi-squares
- Square your z-score to get the chi-square equivalent 
- Square root your chi-square to get the z-score equivalent
