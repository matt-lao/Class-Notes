- *Univariate* - one-dimensional
	- Exploratory - seeing patterns in sample prior to inferences (on a single dimension)
- Usually looking at **Central Tendencies, Dispersion, Shape**

## Measuring Central Tendency in 1-D
- *Mean* - most common summary used to describe the central tendency
	- Not resistant to outliers
	- Doesn't capture the range of values
		- Could have tight values around center
```r
x <- c(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9)
mean(x)
[1] 5.133333

# can pass in the row/col of a matrix
mean(MG[,"Decrease"]) 
	# MG is an matrix
```

## Measuring Dispersion in 1-D
- *Dispersion* - the distance two values are from each other or from a measure of central tendency
	- Common measure is a deviation $(x_i - \bar{x})$ 
		- Fundamental to many things in stats
	- Typically squared $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$ to 
		- Emphasize larger differences
			- Larger diffs are more pronounced
			- Smaller diffs are less
			- "Parabolic transformation" from the center
		- Ensures all positive values
- Sum of all squared deviations for all $n$ values in a dimension are called a *sum of squares*
$$SS = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$
	- Can use the `sum()` function to find it too
```r
ss <- sum((MG[,3] - mean(MG[,3]))^2)
ss
[1] 6778.728
```

The *variance* is found by dividing the sum of squares by $n -1$. 
	- Better than SS b/c SS will always go up when adding more data
$$S^2 = \frac{SS}{n-1} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
	- Can use the `var()` function to find it too
```r
s2 <- ss / (nrow(MG) - 1)
s2
[1] 1355.746

var(MG[,3])  
[1] 1355.746
```
- *Standard Deviation* - Square root of the variance
	- Both variance and standard deviation are affected by outliers too
	- Need to take square root to bring units back to normal (squared earlier)
	- "Average absolute deviation from the mean"
$$S = \sqrt{S^2} = \sqrt{\frac{SS}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$
	- Can be found using `sd()`
```r
s <- sqrt(s2)  
s  
[1] 36.82045  

sd(MG[,3])  
[1] 36.82045
```

- *Quantiles* - divide the data into equally sized consecutive sets
	- Quantile-based measurements are resistant to the effects of outliers (unlike mean-based)
```r
quantile(MG[,3], prob = 0.50)  
50%  
18.9
```
	- Means that 50% of the data is below 18.9
- *Interquartile range* - middle 50%
```r
quantile(x, prob = c(0.25, 0.75))  
25% 75%  
15.3 65.1
```

## Measuring Shape in 1-D
- `Stripchart()` (aka dotplot) can be used to see the shape of a distribution
```r
stripchart(MG[,2], method = "stack")
```
![[Pasted image 20230911222856.png | 300]]
	- Other measures include: histograms, boxplots, and stem-and-leaf displays
- General focus on *modality, symmetry, and kurtosis*
	- *Modality* - number of peaks in a data set
		- *unimodal* - one distinct peak
	- Symmetric - data is approximately the same on either side of a unimodal data set
		- Otherwise is said to be *skewed*
			- Right skewed means tail is on the right (cluster on the left)
			- Left skewed means tail is on the left (cluster on the right)
		- Can be measure mathematically
			![[Pasted image 20230911223520.png | 200]]
```r
g1 <- (1 / nrow(MG) * sum((MG[,2] - mean(MG[,2])) ^ 3)) /  
	(1 / nrow(MG) * sum((MG[,2] - mean(MG[,2])) ^ 2)) ^ (3/2)
g1  
[1] 1.344157 
````
	- Value indicates how many patches are skewed left/right
		- Positive is right skewed - tail is near the postive region
		- Negative is left skewed - tail is near the negative region
	- Unimodal, symmetric would have a skewedness of 0

- *Kurtosis* - measures the 'tailed-ness' of a distribution
	![[Pasted image 20230911223812.png | 200]]
	- Kurtosis of a univariate normal distribution is 3
	- *Platykurtic* - kurtosis less than 3 -- has fewer/less extreme outliers than the normal
		- "Flatter"
	- *Leptokurtic* - kurtosis more than 3 -- tails that asymptotically approach zero more quickly than a normal distribution (more extreme outliers)
		- "Less flat"
- Calculations made easier with packages
	1. Function `install.packages()` or via **Tools -> Install Packages**
	2. Every time we open R, we must call packages using the `library()` function
	- Useful one for shape -> `moments` package
- Moments package
	- Has functions for skewness and kurtosis
	- Used with the `apply()` function
		- Good because it can be used with any function (even with ones that are specific for rows/cols)
```r
apply(X=MG, MARGIN=2, FUN=skewness)
# X -> data matrix
# MARGIN -> 1 for rows, 2 for cols

	  Area   Patches  Decrease  
-0.9485507 1.3441566 0.6493345
# Area - left skewed
# Patches, decrease - right skewed
```

## Normal Distribution
- Symmetric, bell-shaped, no skew
	- Skewness of 0, Kurtosis of 3, can be fully described using the mean/SD
- Since not all distributions are normal -> Transform
	- Ex. using log()
```r
log(MG[,2])
# check to see if skewness is better
skewness(log(MG[,2]))
[1] -0.2562246
```
