The following is the data matrix used for this set of notes.

```r
SIG <- matrix(c(1.54, .10, .10,-.07, .21, .05, .22, .02, .07,-.13, 
				.10, .89, .02, .23,  .12, .03, .08, .08, .10, .73, 
				.10, .02,8.96, .45, .06,-.22, .15, .22, .12, .54, 
				-.07, .23, .45,1.33, .52, .02, .24, .29, .28, .66, 
				.21, .12, .06, .52,1.47, .09, .22, .16, .27, .43, 
				.05, .03,-.22, .02, .09, .26, .07,-.01, .08,-.13, 
				.22, .08, .15, .24, .22, .07, .69, .32, .40, .16, 
				.02, .08, .22, .29, .16,-.01, .32, .56, .36, .17, 
				.07, .10, .12, .28, .27, .08, .40, .36, .84, .15, 
				-.13, .73, .54, .66, .43,-.13, .16, .17, .15,6.69), 
				nrow = 10, ncol = 10, byrow = T, 
				dimnames = list(c("Sex","Age","Income","WorksGardens", 
				"CleansBarns","DrainsLands", "ButchersCows","MilksCows", 
				"BirthsCows","OpticalDensity"), 
				c("Sex","Age","Income","WorksGardens", 
				"CleansBarns","DrainsLands", "ButchersCows","MilksCows", 
				"BirthsCows","OpticalDensity")))
```
*Note: SIG represents a covariance matrix.*

# Revisiting the Loading Matrix
### Separate Predictor and Response Dimensions

It is necessary to separate out *predictor* and *response* dimensions into different sets when preforming exploratory factor analysis.

```r
# covariance matrix of predictor dimensions
SIG_p <- SIG[1:9,1:9] 

# covariance matrix of response dimensions
SIG_r <- SIG[10, 10] 
SIG_r <- as.matrix(SIG_r)
```

We cast `SIG_r` as a matrix since it is a single dimension. This will be the case for a lot of datasets, since they typically have one to two response dimensions that are being studied.

### Calculate Correlation Matrix from Covariance Matrix

While EFA is based on the *correlation structure*, structural equations are based on the *covariance structure*. We can calculate the correlation matrix for `SIG_p` by using the `cov()` function or by using the following matrix algebra in R.

```r
R_p <- (solve(sqrt(diag(diag(SIG_p))))) %*% SIG_p %*% 
		t(solve(sqrt(diag(diag(SIG_p)))))
```

This is based of the general formula to calculate a correlation matrix from a covariance matrix which is: $$R = \left(\left(\sqrt{diag(\Sigma)}\right)^{-1}\right) \times \Sigma \times \left(\left(\sqrt{diag(\Sigma)}\right)^{-1}\right)$$
*Where $R$ is the correlation matrix, and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix*.

After this calculation in R it is a good habit to reestablish the proper row and column names, since they are not preserved after this calculation. This can be done with the `dimnames()` function as follows.

```r
dimnames(R_p) <- list(c("Sex","Age","Income","WorksGardens", 
						"CleansBarns","DrainsLands", 
						"ButchersCows","MilksCows","BirthsCows"), 
						c("Sex","Age","Income","WorksGardens", 
						"CleansBarns","DrainsLands", 
						"ButchersCows","MilksCows","BirthsCows"))
```

### Begin Exploratory Factor Analysis

The first step in EFA is to find the intrinsic dimensionality.

```r
eigen(R_p)$values
[1] 2.5308671 1.2333196 1.0816741 1.0335368 0.9081244 0.8047493 
[7] 0.5494241 0.4411884 0.4171161
```

Let's use Kaiser's criterion, which would say this set of dimensions can be represented using four factors.

To determine if an oblique rotation is necessary or not, we can call the `pca()` function with the `"oblimin"` as the value of the `rotate` argument.

```r
pca(r = R_p, nfactors = 4, rotate = "oblimin")
```

We must look at the *factor correlation matrix* from the output of `pca()`to determine if an oblique rotation is necessary.

```r 
With component correlations of 
     TC1  TC3   TC2   TC4 
TC1 1.00 0.33  0.01  0.08 
TC3 0.33 1.00  0.02  0.05 
TC2 0.01 0.02  1.00 -0.08 
TC4 0.08 0.05 -0.08  1.00
```

The correlation between `TC1` and `TC3` is $>3$, so an oblique rotation was necessary.

We can then extract the obliquely rotated loading matrix.

```r
A <- pca(r = R_p, nfactors = 4, rotate = "oblimin")$loadings[] 
round(A, 3)
```


# Defining the Measurement Model

The *measurement model* part of a path diagram defines the relationships between original dimensions and factors.

This can be done with ease using an external flow chart editor such as [this](https://app.diagrams.net/).

In this diagram factors are represented with circles and dimensions are represented with squares. The arrows indicate *directed relationship* toward factors, meaning that the factor's presence results in the presence of the dimensions that comprise it.

### Adjust Path Diagram

We need to account for the following things in the example path diagram:
- Eliminate one-to-one relationships between factors and dimensions. Instead just replace the factor with the dimension (as a box).
	- This is called retaining "outside of a dimension", this is noted by bold lettering.
- Represent correlated factors with an *undirected relationship* (two-arrowed connection).
- Name all factors that are natural to name. If unnatural, revisit intrinsic dimensionality and investigate if a different number of factors results in a easier naming process.
- If complex dimension still remain, retain them outside of a factor and represent the *undirected relationship* with the factors they load onto.

### Add Response Factors/Dimensions

If there is no factor for the response dimension, just represent outside of a factor.

# Defining the Structural Model

The *structural model* part of a path diagram defines the relationships between the predictor and response variables. 

These can be represented using directed lines from the predictor dimensions/factors to the response dimensions/factors.

# Identifying Hidden Constructs

Hidden constructs are necessary for the proper parameterization of a structural equation model.

*Dependent variables* are constructs with arrows pointing at them. These will be assigned constructs pointing directly to them. For dimensions they will be assigned *errors*, and for factors they will assigned *disturbances*. In the diagram these are visualized as as boxes labeled `E1` or `D1` respectively. 

*Independent variables* are constructs with arrows point away from them. These will be assigned a *variance*, which will visual look like an *undirected relationship* with itself.
