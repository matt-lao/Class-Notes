## Co-variability
- Bivariate relationships/trends

## Scatterplots

- Good visual summary
- Direction
	- Positive/negative
	- non-causal (unless randomized controlled experiment)
- Shape
	- Linear/non-linear
- Strength
	- Strong/weak
	- Similar to dispersion

## Quadrant Analysis
- Centroid - made up of two means
	- ($\bar x_1,\bar x_2$)
	- This coordinate on a scatter plot would be in the "center" of the data
	- Can break up the data into quadrants -- good for quick visual analysis
- Sum of products/cross-products

- Covariance from SP
	![[Pasted image 20230921102029.png]]
- Correlation
	![[Pasted image 20230921102307.png]]
	- $S_1$ and $S_2$ are standard deviations
	- Good for comparisons - unitless
	- [-1,1]
		- Sign indicates direction of relations
		- Absolute quantity indicates strength (0.1 - weak, 0.9 - strong) 
	- Need to know if linear -> use scatter plot
