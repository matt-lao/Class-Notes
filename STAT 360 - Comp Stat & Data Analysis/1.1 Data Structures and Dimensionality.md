## Getting Started in R
- `c()` concatenates data into a single object
	- Can be used to build an 1D array
- `rm()` can remove an object from the environment
	- `rm(list = ls())` removes all objects from an environment

## Matrices in R
- matrix()
```r
m <- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), nrow = 2, ncol = 3) # basic construction
```
	- column-major storage: data fills up the column by default
- Indexing - 1 based
```r
m[2,3] # index (row, col)
# OR
m[6] # index with how they are stored internally (as a 1D array)
# OR
m[,"Wolves"] # index based on the row/col name (if applicable)
```
- Selecting sets of specific rows/cols
```r
m[,c(2,3)] # selects the 2nd and 3rd columns 
```
- `rbind()` - binds together matrices by row
- `cbind()` - binds together matrices by column

## Complex Data Matrices
```r 
isleRoyale <- matrix(c(1300, 2,  
					   1600, 2,  
					   1475, 2,  
					   2060, 15), nrow = 4, ncol = 2, byrow = T,  
					   dimnames = list(c("2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"),
					   c("Moose","Wolves")))

```
- Use `dimnames()` and pass in a list of column names, then row names
- Use `byrow = T` argument to read in the data in *row-major order*
- Excel file
	- Alternatively, we can import existing excel files as data frames by selecting the **File Menu**, then **Import Dataset -> From Excel** or **Import Dataset -> From Text (base)** if using a .csv file.
- Comparisons
```r
isleRoyale[,1] > 1500
```
	- returns a boolean for each column
- `which()` - conditional that returns the index of data that meets the condition
```r
which(isleRoyale[,1] > 1500)
```

## Dimensionality of Data
- Dimensionality - how many variables are in the data
	- Number of columns -- NOT Rows x Cols
- `dim()` returns number of rows then columns
	- rows = cases
